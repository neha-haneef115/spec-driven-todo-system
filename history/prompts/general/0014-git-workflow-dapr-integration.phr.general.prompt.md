# Git Workflow: DAPR Integration for Taskflow Application

## Summary

Successfully executed Git workflow to commit DAPR integration changes for the Taskflow application and create a pull request. The changes include:

- DAPR integration with Taskflow backend, frontend, and mcp-server services
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configurations for all services
- Helm chart updates with DAPR annotations and configurations
- Removal of sample DAPR applications that were incorrectly included
- Creation of README-DAPR.md with instructions for running actual application

## Changes Made

### DAPR Integration
- Added DAPR annotations to all Taskflow service deployments
- Configured DAPR components for pub/sub and state management
- Updated Helm chart with conditional DAPR integration

### Auto-scaling Support
- Created HPA configurations for backend, frontend, and mcp-server
- Configured scaling from 1 to 50 instances as per requirements
- Added configurable HPA settings in values.yaml

### Documentation
- Created README-DAPR.md with proper instructions for running Taskflow application
- Emphasized that only actual Taskflow services are included, not sample apps
- Included verification steps and operational guidance

### Cleanup
- Removed sample DAPR applications that were incorrectly mixed with Taskflow
- Added dapr binary to .gitignore to prevent large file commits

## Pull Request

The changes were successfully committed and pushed to the branch, and a pull request was created:
https://github.com/neha-haneef115/todo-spec-driven-hackathon/pull/12

## Outcome

The Taskflow application now has full DAPR integration with proper service annotations, pub/sub messaging, state management, and auto-scaling capabilities. The implementation follows the requirements and focuses on the actual Taskflow services rather than sample applications.
