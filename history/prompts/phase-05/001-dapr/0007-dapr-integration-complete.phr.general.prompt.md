# DAPR Integration Completion with PR Suggestions Applied

## Summary

Successfully completed DAPR integration for the Taskly application with all PR review suggestions applied. The implementation includes DAPR sidecars for all Taskly services (backend, frontend, mcp-server) with proper service invocation, pub/sub messaging, and state management capabilities.

## Changes Applied

### PR Review Suggestions Applied:
1. **S001**: Removed sample DAPR application files that contradicted PR description
2. **S002**: Updated Zipkin endpoint from `/api/v1/spans` to `/api/v2/spans` for modern compatibility
3. **S003**: Made Redis host configurable via Kubernetes secret reference instead of hardcoded values
4. **S004**: Added Prometheus deployment to complement monitoring configuration
5. **S005**: Provided explicit path for dapr-components in NOTES.txt

### DAPR Integration Features:
- Service invocation capabilities via DAPR sidecars
- Pub/sub messaging through configured components
- State management with configurable Redis connection
- Configuration management and observability
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling from 1 to 50 instances

### Documentation:
- Created README-DAPR.md in phase-05 folder with instructions for running actual Taskly application
- Updated Helm chart documentation with DAPR integration details
- Updated NOTES.txt with explicit paths and instructions

## Verification

All changes have been:
- Committed to the repository with descriptive commit message
- Pushed to the remote branch phase-05/001-dapr
- Verified working with DAPR integration active
- Tested for proper service communication and scaling

## Outcome

The Taskly application now has full DAPR integration with all PR suggestions applied. The implementation focuses on the actual Taskly services (backend, frontend, mcp-server) rather than sample applications, and includes proper auto-scaling, monitoring, and configuration management.
