## Prompt

sp.analyze

## Response snapshot

Performed comprehensive analysis of DAPR implementation artifacts (spec, plan, tasks) identifying critical constitution violations, coverage gaps, and inconsistencies. Found 1 critical issue with technology stack alignment, 1 high severity ambiguity, and several medium/low issues requiring attention before implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified critical constitution violation requiring specification revision
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Analyzed spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md for consistency and completeness
- 🔁 Next prompts: Need to revise specification to align with constitution before implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Analysis revealed important gaps between specification and constitution requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Critical constitution violation identified (Kafka mentioned in spec conflicts with tech stack)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Revise specification to align with constitution requirements
